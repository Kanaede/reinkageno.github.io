            <p>Everyone laughed at my stupidity and craziness, not a single person wanted to look at me, let alone help me. Why do humans have no heart, why in their heads flattery is better than friends, why?</p>
            <p>I can only see myself being fought by the whole world, I can see myself falling down, dying. People passing by kicked me and stepped on me without feeling, they were satisfied with their problems and took it out on me several times more.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Seeing me cry like a classmate who was bullied at school, they really looked forward to it. Yeah... I couldn't even feel anything when it happened, just like normal pain, then dying and being unconscious, it all happened without compassion.</p>
            <p>
                Come on, I still have a lot of endurance, finish it off until it's just one or empty it, I'll enjoy it while I'm unconscious. <br>
                If it makes you happy and satisfied I will let you, don't be sad or angry, vent and take it all out on me, no matter how big it is. Sick of the world, I'm helpless and just waiting for the time, maybe one day when my endurance runs out, I will explode one world.
