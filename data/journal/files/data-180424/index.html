          <P>
            I woke up today, why did I wake up? What's special? <br>
            I don't know... but my dream seems to be telling me something.. I can see it, asking me "Who are you, why are you so different from us." And without my control, I answered, "I am someone from the Future and the Past." <br>
            Then after I said that to him I woke up from my dream. I was scared and confused by what I said. <strong>I'm someone from the Future and the Past,</strong> I always think about this for a while after waking up.
          </P>
          <p>
            Why... why this dream, why did I wake up? That scared me! He asked when we were in the train, there was no one else but us. Alone, he seemed to represent billions of billions of people to me, yes I.. <strong>DIFFERENT</strong>. <br>
            Sad, why am I different from other people? Why am I here.. what am I doing here? I'm useless. <br>
            After that.. I'm pensive and sitting still as if sleeping with his eyes open, until my Mom shouts to me "Hey woke up, don't be stunned!" I want to cry, but nobody lets me cry or think about what I want. <br>
            Rules and Destiny, World and Dreams.. continuing without a care in the world is like a bulldozer pushing the ground without mercy.
