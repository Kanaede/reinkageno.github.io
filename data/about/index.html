                <p>I am just a naughty fox wandering in the wild among humans.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mx-auto pb-3 mb-3 mb-md-5 text-md-start">
                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, I'm just a naughty fox. I like the forest and the sea, even though I know foxes are very weak against the wild. They wander around just looking for food and then sleep. <br>
                    But I was alone, neither family nor colony... Lonely all my life with very strange questions. Life is easy, but humans love to complicate it, but life is full of strange things that living creatures cannot know. Humans always leave messages to other humans when they go away forever. <br>
                </p>
                  <br>
                <h3>It all hurts</h3>
                <p>
                    Living without the help of people is difficult, and I still need humans to live, but losing such a kind human is an incredible torment for this little fox. I know that everything that exists will disappear, but I can't just accept that, even though I know I'm helpless in front of the human corpse. <br>
                    Everyone depends too much on me, they think I'm great, accomplished, strong, never gives up, none of that is true. I live alone and that's who I am, I can only support myself without being able to help other people.
                </p>
                  <br>
                <h2 class="text-md-center text-primary">This is my world</h2>
                <h3>I'm a little kid</h3>
                <p>
                    I have a random nature, but it's quite fun, as if I'm a different person... maybe more precisely seeing another world with different people. Yeah, it's strange... but I often feel like I'm living in another world with another body, and it's ridiculous when I think about it. <br>
                    I don't expect to grow up and that doesn't mean I want to stay small, but in reality I am small. Living as an adult may be fun, but it sometimes makes you neglect your duties as an adult, after all, where can a fox be an adult? Ha ha ha <br><br>
                    I act like a stupid and stupid child, I'm too lazy to act like a smart person who gets into a lot of problems with questions looking for solutions. Maybe you are too stupid to choose who is smart and who is really stupid.
                </p>
                  <br><br>
                <h3>My food is about My hunger</h3>
                <p>
                    Yeah, like food... sometimes I eat snacks when I'm free or tired, but sometimes I drink beer when I'm so excited that I forget about everything. I like to eat things that are not spicy, even though people say spicy is delicious, I prefer sweet foods like pancakes. <br>
                    I'll crush a biscuit and eat it or chew the wrapper when I feel like killing someone, even though I'm too lazy to risk it. If I have a grudge, don't expect to win against me, because if I have a grudge it will no longer be me...
                </p>
                  <br><br>
                <h3>My family are monsters</h3>
                <p>
                  Here I have two parents, my father and my mother, but my father always doesn't care about me and only cares about his work, while my mother is always loyal to the people at <br><br>
                  My mother always cleans the house and nags as usual, but she is different, she is always loyal to the people at home and doesn't care about my father anymore who only cares about his work. My mother always supported me from behind, even to the point where she used the last coin for the benefit of our lives. <br>
                  My mother is nice but sometimes she doesn't know what's really happening in the outside world, and that makes her a little illogical. Times have changed, maybe also because the thinking in the past was different, and my mother still used the logic of that era. <br><br>
                  While my father always worked late into the night, he sometimes woke up very late, we almost didn't care about him because he always thought we were a burden who couldn't make much money. For my father money was everything and he ended up as a father without love. <br><br>
                  The two of them didn't get along and that was quite scary because we had reached a critical period where work was scarce. Yeah it was the Covid-17 era, I couldn't buy anything, but my mother always took the time to cheer me up. My father is very stingy but at least he doesn't ask for money back when I need something important. <br>
                  And I don't consider them family anymore
                </p>
                  <br><br>
                <h3>I am ...</h3>
                <p>
                  I'm a Fox, and I have many names, but I like the name Kanaede. Name? I have many names, I am Kanna, I am also Kannade or Rein, I am also Fonte.
