                <p>I am just a naughty fox wandering in the wild among humans.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mx-auto pb-3 mb-3 mb-md-5 text-md-start">
                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, I'm just a naughty fox. I like the forest and the sea, even though I know foxes are very weak against the wild. They wander around just looking for food and then sleep. <br>
                    But I was alone, neither family nor colony... Lonely all my life with very strange questions. Life is easy, but humans love to complicate it, but life is full of strange things that living creatures cannot know. Humans always leave messages to other humans when they go away forever. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>It all hurts</h3>
                <p>
                    Living without the help of people is difficult, and I still need humans to live, but losing such a kind human is an incredible torment for this little fox. I know that everything that exists will disappear, but I can't just accept that, even though I know I'm helpless in front of the human corpse. <br>
                    Everyone depends too much on me, they think I'm great, accomplished, strong, never gives up, none of that is true. I live alone and that's who I am, I can only support myself without being able to help other people.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="text-md-center text-primary">This is my world</h2>
                <h3>I'm a little kid</h3>
                <p>
                    I have a random nature, but it's quite fun, as if I'm a different person... maybe more precisely seeing another world with different people. Yeah, it's strange... but I often feel like I'm living in another world with another body, and it's ridiculous when I think about it. <br>
                    I don't expect to grow up and that doesn't mean I want to stay small, but in reality I am small. Living as an adult may be fun, but it sometimes makes you neglect your duties as an adult, after all, where can a fox be an adult? Ha ha ha <br><br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>My food is about My hunger</h3>
                <p>
                    Yeah, like food... sometimes I eat snacks when I'm free or tired, but sometimes I drink beer when I'm so excited that I forget about everything. I like to eat things that are not spicy, even though people say spicy is delicious, I prefer sweet foods like pancakes. <br>
